My First Blog Post
==================
I apologize in advance if you were expecting an incredibly tehnical blog. The following blog post is mostly personal and depicts my growth as a programmer over the past year.

The past year has been nothing short of an amazing journey. After my first year at UT, I got an internship at [Telogis](http://www.telogis.com), writing C#. I stayed on full-time after the summer internship to gain in-state residency and cut tuition costs by three quarters. My programming knowledge prior to the internship had been shaky at best (I was a freshman and relied only on what I had learned in high school), but I can confidently say that after one year programming for a living in the "real world", I have learned so so much.

My summer project started out as me writing a C# application made to consume from a RabbitMQ queue and subsequently insert into MongoDB. I dove into things I had never used before (threads?!, messaging protocols?!, noSQL?!). Then, front end ASP.net MVC application to serve as a tool to view queries made to a MongoDB backend. I learned more about web development, HTTP, and the MVC architectural pattern. I also started getting into front end development, and being angry at CSS.

Then, I inherited a codebase that was used to send SSH commands to thousands of different clients. It, too had a front end and a back end, but this time the data store was using postgreSQL. I knew a bit about SQL before, but after this writing SQL has gotten to be a breeze.

Next, I dove into some Nodejs + Express. Despite the application not making it into production, I learned a ton through Node's callback based programming styles and loved the "pick and choose through npm" way of building an application. I started using Nodejs for all my web development work, because it was fun.

Passing functions around as data in Node and higher order functions like in LINQ started making me appreciate functional programming styles more, and I've decided to start learning Haskell. 

I guess the point is that if you ever get the opportunity to take an internship wherein the company trusts its interns and gives them _real_, _non trivial_, work. Totally do it. There's nothing better for your own progress and development than being thrown in the deep end.
