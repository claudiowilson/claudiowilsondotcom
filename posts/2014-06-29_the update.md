the update
==========
There we go, I finally converted the site to single page angularjs. It was a much better choice as anticipated because as a single page application, the background doesn't have to reload when navigating around the site.

Not much to say other than the fact that angular was pretty straightforward. Angular is an MVC framework after all. I'm still very new to it so there are a lot of things I don't know, but it's definitely a neat framework. A lot of things that used to be handled server side went to the client. All security sensitive stuff is still done properly though, (I hope). 

I still don't have an answer to how jarring the album art is when in context with blog posts and other material you want the user to actually look at. That can come later. For now, on to bigger, cooler projects!
