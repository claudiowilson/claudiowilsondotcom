Favorite Music
==============
I know I haven't posted in a long long time, so in an attempt to fix that, I'm going to do a short post talking about the tracks I've heard that have stood out the most to me. This isn't a music critic post, it's personal and I've just resonated with these songs for one reason or another. I think they're great, but that may also be because I tied a personal memory to each song while listening to them.

Here we go, in no specific order:

### Nicolas Jaar - And I Say (Xinobi Edit)

There's just something incredibly groovy, textural, and visceral about this track. The drums, the vocals and the vibe just blend into something incredibly unique.

### Daft Punk - Veridis Quo

My favorite Daft Punk song of all time. This song is a masterpiece in my eyes. The progression is amazing. Discovery also has to be one of my favorite albums out there.

### Radiohead - Nude

This track sends shivers down my spine every time I listen to it. Thom Yorke's vocals combined with Nigel Godrich's slow, eerie production makes for a thought provoking, melancholic track. My favorite Radiohead song.

### Arcade Fire - Rebellion (Lies)

The song builds up to an incredible crescendo, all around fantastic song.

### Giraffage - Music Sounds Better With You

I really have to give credit for this song to Thomas Bangalatar and Stardust because they made the first version of it, but I really love the spin Giraffage takes on a timeless classic. I've listened to this track way too much.
